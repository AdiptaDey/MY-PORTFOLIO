<h3>Hi there!<br></h3>
<p> 
    
    
    I'm Adipta Dey, studying Computer Science and Engineering at Independent
    University,
    Bangladesh. I'm excited to share my work with you on this portfolio website. <br> <br>
    I am looking forward to working in an environment where there is an
    opportunity for self-assessment and self-improvement in individual
    and team-based work. Also, I want to gain experience in such
    professional platforms, and I believe I have the capability for it. <br> <br>
    Now, as a student, I'm learning the skills and knowledge I need to become a successful
    engineer.</p>
