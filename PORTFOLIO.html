            <h3>Hi there!<br></h3>
            <p>


                I'm  <b>Adipta Dey,</b> studying Computer Science and Engineering at Independent
                University,
                Bangladesh. I'm excited to share my work with you on this portfolio website. <br> <br>
                I am looking forward to working in an environment where there is an
                opportunity for self-assessment and self-improvement in individual
                and team-based work. Also, I want to gain experience in such
                professional platforms, and I believe I have the capability for it. <br> <br>
                Now, as a student, I'm learning the skills and knowledge I need to become a successful
                engineer.</p>
